#processor 1
# calculate u0 in room 2 with default gamma 1 and gamma 2
# send neumann to processor 0 and 2

#processor 0 and 2
# recieve neumann from processor 1
# calculate u0 in room 1 and room 3 with neumann from processor 1
# send temperatures at gamma 1 and gamma 2 to processor 1

#####    loop    ####

#processor 1
# extract temp. at gamma 1 and gamma 2 from previous u
# calculate u(k+1) in room 2
# send neumann to processor 0 and 2

#processor 0 and 2
# recieve neumann from 0 and 2
# calculate u(k+1) in room 1 and 3 with neumann
# send all temperatures to processor 1

#processor 1
# recieve all temperatures from processors 0 and 2
